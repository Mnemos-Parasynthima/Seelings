    "Recall that the stack grows (downwards is the norm but it can also grow upwards). Additionally, the stack has stack frames (also known as activation records or activation frames) that are per-function, which keep track of locals and arguments. This is one form of a scope, the function scope. The call stack (or function stack or also just The stack), works just like the stack data structure. Recall the classic operations: push and pop. This applies for the call stack, as in pushing and popping frames, and more in detail, pushing/popping data.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the macro level, stack frames are pushed and popped off the stack each time a function gets called (push) and returns (popped). At the micro level, variables/data are/is pushed and popped off. Recall the assembly in **Module 1**. The instruction `push` (and its counter `pop`) push/pop the data provided to it. This performs other operations underneath the hood (not within this scope) but it indicates the beginning/end of a function. Data is pushed only if it needs saving*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*When looking at dissassembly of C code, I often see the compiler pushing data that there is no need to save but maybe it is because of the design trying to compile general code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data that is not statically created (this gets placed in the data segments) is placed in the stack. One clear example is in **Module 1** for the example with `highestGrades`. In `main()`, the `grades` array is declared and built. Looking at the assembly, one can see `mov DWORD PTR [rbp-0x30],0x64`. For now, `rbp` just points to the current pointer to the stack. So, it moves `0x64` to the stack at position `rbp-0x30`. Additionally, this is how arguments are passed in, although depending on the calling convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a frame is popped off, nothing is being removed. The pointer is simply moved. And when a new frame is pushed, the pointer is changed, meaning the new data overrides the old. This is why it is dangerous to return pointers to stack-allocated data."

However, memory consumption/usage is required to think about when writing C. If no data is freed when done being used (memory leak), over time, the leaks will pile up while more memory is requested, until at some point, the operating system just stops it.

If a pointer would be the number `0x20de4` and then attempted to be used, the system would see that it is ran by a user procress and the address is in a reserved space, thus it would lead to a segmentation fault (oh the dreaded segfault!) and crash. This leads to the most common type of segfault: null pointers.\n",

    "Adding/subtracting pointers simply allows us to \"move\" through memory. This was seen prior regarding arrays. Since arrays are contigious bytes of memory, iterating through them simply means adding to a pointer then dereferencing. If `int* arr;`, then `*(arr + 3)` would first add 3 to the address held by `arr`, then from there, access/dereference it. However, recall that integers are 4 bytes long. If `+3` is to be taken literally, `arr+3` would result in holding the first/last (depending on endianness) byte of the integer, which is a big no-no. By doing `*(arr+3)`, we meant to get the third elementh of `arr`. Instead of figuring out how many bytes it takes from `arr`, when performing pointer arithmetic, the compiler already takes care of the data type sizing, so `arr+3` (when taken literally) would be `arr + (4 * 3)` (integer is 4 bytes, 3rd position).\n",

    "A major caveat is regarding void pointers. Since void is consider a type (or rather a lack thereof), having `void*` simply means a pointer to an arbitrary address, meaning we do not care of the type of data at that address (can be implemented to be a generic). When trying to access a `void*`, the way to go is casting to a known type. This would then provide information regarding sizing."
