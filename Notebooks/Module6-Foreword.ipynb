    "Remember that **Seelings** is just to test current basic knowledge and is not in any form of high complexity. Also, since you are running MacOS, there are some differences compared to how Linux operates. Additionally, libraries differ. For example, Windows has `<Windows.h>` while Linux has `<unistd.h>` (which is used in comp arch). My recommendation is to learn those linux-specific utilities and functionalities. This can either be by simply using some web-based system, simply looking/learning through videos, run some system emulator like QEMU, or for a more hardcore way, running a VM. I have the fortune of using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) that allows me to run linux utilities and non-gui programs."
