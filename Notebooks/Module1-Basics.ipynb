    "There are two additional bit operations:\n",
    "- `<<`: logical left shift\n",
    "- `>>`: logical/arithmetic right shift\n",
    "\n",
    "These, as their name implies, shift the bits of a number.\n",
    "For example, `3 << 2` means shift `3` to the left by `2` bits. In binary form: `0b11 << 2`. So the two `1`s are shifted to the left by 2: `0b1100`. Note that shifting left creates `0`s on the least significant bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are two types of right shifts, due to the nature of signed and unsigned. Arithmetic fills in the (leftmost/most significant) bits to `1`s instead of `0`s (which logical does). This preserves two's complements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "`-90 >> 2` when `signed char -90;` is in binary form `0b1010_0110 >> 2`, arithmetic shifting would result in `0b1110_1001`. Note that `0b10` from the end got \"chopped off\" and `0b11` were added in the most significant bits.\n",

    "To extract a bit (or bitrange), three operands are needed: the number itself, a mask, and a shift.\n",
    "A mask indicates \"how many bits\" one wants to work on. Extracting a single bit would result in the mask simply being `0b1`. However, extracting a range would require more `1`s. For example, if the range is to be 4 bits long, the mask would need to be `0b1111`. The shift ensures the extracting begins at the right place and results in just the needed number."
