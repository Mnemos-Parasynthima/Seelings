# Seelings

Welcome to `seelings`!

This project is to simply employ understanding of the C language. By no means does it teach/inform about it, and so, everything assumes basic prior knowledge.
However, there is a complementary notebook that is for review only and goes in details regarding the exercises.

The project is split into modules with some exercises in each module, ending the entire thing with a small project to write.
For each exercise, you need to either complete it and/or fix an issue, as described in the TODO comments.

To start:
- run `seelings` in this directory
- complete each exercise, using the program to compile it, run it, and test it

You can stop at any time and save. The quit function ('q') will save the current position and quit. Running the program again will resume.

## Layout

- Module 1: Basics
  - This module tests on some basics of C, like strings, functions, arrays.
- Module 2: Memory
  - This module tests on the memory aspect, such as pointers (a major aspect of C), the stack and heap, and allocation.
- Module 3: Derived Types
  - This module tests on more complex types, what one can call it as "classes" and how they interact.
- Module 5: Project
  - This module combines knowledge of memory, pointers, and strings. Although this does not cover everything, it can be a good foundation regarding one of the hardest things in C.
